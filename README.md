## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned how to use Flexbox efficiently. I learned how to use event listners other than 'click'.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for in creating a red outline color when the user input is zero and helped me to creat inputs which only accept numbers. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
